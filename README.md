# Amber Framework
Amber Framework is based on the principle "Convention over Configuration".

## Yet another PHP Framework?
Amber Framework is an attempt to merge some features inspired from Ruby on Rails, and Django's Python, that are not yet on the PHP universe, hopefully, it's not gonna end up as a copy of every other PHP framework that offers just the same.

## Usage

### Instalation
```
git clone https://github.com/systemson/amber.git
```

### Running the app

Open a terminal and move to the project folder, then run the commnand:

```
php amber run
```
This will start the PHP dev server on the project folder.


Aditionally you can open the project on your default explorer with the option **--explorer|-e"**:
```
php amber run -e
```

Or you could set the browser manually with the option **--explorer**|**-e** and the explorer name as param like:
```
php amber run -e firefox
```
