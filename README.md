# Amber Framework
Amber Framework is based on the principle "Convention over Configuration".

## Yet another PHP Framework?
Amber Framework is an attempt to merge some features inspired from Ruby on Rails, and Django's Python, that are not yet on the PHP universe, hopefully, it's not gonna end up as a copy of every other PHP framework that offers just the same.

## Usage

### Instalation
```
git clone https://github.com/systemson/amber.git
```

### Running the app

Open a terminal and move to the project folder, then run.

```
php amber run
```

This will run the PHP dev server and open the default browser. You can set the browser manually with the **--explorer**|**-e** param:
```
php amber run --explorer=chrome
```

Or:
```
php amber run -e chrome
```
